This folder contains three different simulations of cellular potts model. 

CPM.mp4 is a cellular potts model with a rectangular cell of cell width = 100 and cell height = 3. Thus, the cell size is 300. Through the simulation, the cell fragments and assemble as a rectangular cell. The fragmentation of the cell is probably due to the absence of cell shape definition in the total Hamiltonian energy. The total Hamiltonian is defined with only cell size and adhesion.

cpm_simulation1.mp4 is a cellular potts model with two rectangular cells of different sizes but the same type placed right next to each other in the lattice. The total cell size is 600. The cells stay together and adjust to form a circular cell after a complete simulation run. No fragmentation is observed or noticed.

cpm_simulation2.mp4 is a cellular potts model with two rectangular cells of the same type but different sizes are placed apart in the lattice. The total cell size is 150. During the cell updates in the simulation, we observe no fragmentation in neither cell but one cell decreases in size while the other increases till the total cell size is attained. The cells merge by one completely decreasing in the lattice.
